    Normally pool retention strategy maintains a pool of a fixed number of agents.
    If Spare Pool is enabled, then a pool of spare agents are maintained.

    For example if pool size is 3 and there are two agents in use, then the
    plugin will build 3 more agents to ensure there are three 3 spare
    agents ready to accept incoming builds.

    This is convenient when agents are only used for a single build before
    being destroyed.
