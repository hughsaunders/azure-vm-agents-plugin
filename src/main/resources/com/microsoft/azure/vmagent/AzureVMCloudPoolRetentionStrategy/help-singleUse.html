    Destroy each instance after it has run a build.

    This is similar to the Once retention strategy, except it is part of the
    pool strategy so that the plugin can ensure there are instances ready
    to accept incoming builds.

    If you use the once strategy (not this option to the pool strategy),
    each node will be provisioned on demand which adds provisioning time
    to the build time.

    Alternatively if you use the pool strategy with this option and Spare Pool
    enabled, you can have single use instances that are provisioned in advance
    and ready for instant use.
